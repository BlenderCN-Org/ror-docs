## Installing mods from the Repository

!!! warning
    Not all content has been re-uploaded to the new Repository yet. The old Repository may be found [here](http://www.austingratzer.com/rigs/downloads.php)

**To download mods from the Repository, you must have a registered & verified account on the Forum.**

### Downloading

Visit the [Repository](https://forum.rigsofrods.org/resources/).

![repository](/images/repository.png)

Find something you like. For example, how about the nice [1996 Dodge Viper GTS Coupe](https://forum.rigsofrods.org/resources/1996-dodge-viper-gts-coupe.88/):

![repository-mod](/images/repository-mod.png)

Click the *Download* button at the top right of the page:

![repository-dl](/images/repository-download.png)

If you see ![repository-no-perms](/images/repository-download-no-perms.png) that means you are either not logged into your Forum account or your account is not verified.

### Installing

Once the mod is downloaded, simply place the `*.zip` file into `Documents\Rigs of Rods 0.4\packs` or `~/.rigsofrods/packs` on Linux:

![repository-install](/images/repository-installing-mod.png)

**NEVER extract the zip file unless specifically mentioned in the file description! I cannot stress this enough.**

If you want more organization, you can place the `.zip` file into `vehicles` or `terrains`, depending on what type of mod you downloaded.

That's it! You can launch Rigs of Rods now and your shiny new mod should be ready to use.

## Installing skinzips

Some mods may provide a `*.skinzip` which contains some extra liveries/skins for the vehicle. To install these, they are also placed in the `packs` folder.

For more information about skinzips, see [this page](/vehicle-creation/alternate-skins/).

## PSD/PDN files

These are files meant to be used by photo editing programs such as Photoshop or paint.net, they are not meant to be placed in the RoR directories.
